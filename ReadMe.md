## Tokenizer
The code above is a module for tokenization classes in the Google AI Language Team's BERT model. It provides functions to convert text into tokens that can be used in BERT's model. The module is written in python, and it uses the tensorflow library.

## Dependencies
Python 3.6 <br>
Tensorflow 1.13.1

The main functions in the module are:

validate_case_matches_checkpoint: This function checks whether the casing configuration is consistent with the checkpoint name. The casing information should have been stored in the bert_config.json file, but if it's not, this function heuristically detects it to validate. If the casing information is inconsistent with the checkpoint name, it raises a ValueError.
convert_to_unicode: This function converts the input text to Unicode (if it's not already) and assumes that the input is in UTF-8 encoding.
printable_text: This function returns the text encoded in a way that's suitable for print or for the tf.logging function.
The module also includes several import statements for libraries that are used in the functions, such as re (regular expressions), six (for compatibility between Python 2 and 3), and tensorflow.

## PreProcessing
This code defines the InputExample class which is used to store the data of a single example in the dataset. Each example contains a unique identifier (guid), the id of the first text (text_a_id), the first text (text_a), the id of the second text (text_b_id), the second text (text_b), and a label. The label is used to store the target value for a supervised learning task. The class is used to store the data in a convenient and organized manner which makes it easier to process the data.

## Reading the pretrained model BERT 

This is code for processing and converting text data for use in fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model for text classification.

The function read_processed_file reads in a text file and saves the contents into a list of lists, where each inner list represents a line of the file with 5 elements: context id, context, persona id, persona, and label.

The function create_examples takes the list of lines as an input and creates InputExample objects to represent each line. Each InputExample object contains a unique identifier, the context and persona ids, the context and persona text, and the label.

The function _truncate_seq_pair takes in two token lists and a maximum length, and truncates the longer list until the total length of both lists is less than or equal to the maximum length.

The function convert_examples_to_features converts the InputExample objects into a list of InputBatch objects for use in the BERT model. This involves tokenizing the context and persona text and truncating the sequences if necessary. The label for each example is mapped to a numerical index for use in the model.

## BERT Fine tuning

The code is a tokenization script for the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, a pre-trained transformer language model for NLP tasks such as question answering and sentiment analysis. This script takes in text and returns a list of tokens (sub-word units) that can be fed into the BERT model for fine-tuning on a specific task.

The script first converts the text into Unicode (UTF-8 encoded string). Then, it applies text normalization, which includes lowercasing the text if specified and removing punctuation. The script then splits the text into words and applies a wordpiece tokenization algorithm, which splits words into sub-word units based on a pre-defined vocabulary. The resulting tokens are added to a list and returned as the final output.

## Testing the code
unzip the file and
just Run the data_process_tfrecord.py and watch the output (it may take more than 30 minutes depending on speed of your computer!)
